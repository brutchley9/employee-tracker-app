# Employee Tracker App


For this week's activity, I will be utilizing further understanding of back-end web development practicies, as well as a new foundation in MySQL database management, to create an app tracking employee information and activity. This application will be invoked and accessed entirely from the command line, as our last few challenges have been. I will also be utilizing Inquirer, Express.js and MySQL2 as developer depenedencies within the app, so they will have to be downloaded before use. This information is included within the package.json file for this application.

A walkthrough video will also be provided for further demonstration once the application has been completed.
